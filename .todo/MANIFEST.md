1. **(.todo/plans/1-fix-study-detail-interactivity.md)**:

### Name

Fix: Study-detail page unstyled/non-interactive under /workbench subpath

### Status: ✅ CONFIRMED FIXED (browser-verified)

PR OPEN (REVIEW_REQUIRED) — https://github.com/vivarium-collective/vivarium-workbench/pull/465; merged into demo-v2ecoli (861aefa). k8s image rebuilt+deployed to sms-api-stanford-test (e74b644). The 2026-07-13 browser walkthrough confirmed the study-detail page renders + is interactive under `/workbench`. Only remaining item is PR merge to main (hygiene, non-blocking).

## 2. **(.todo/plans/2-fix-csrf-origin-guard-reverse-proxy.md)**:

### Name

Fix: CSRF/origin guard 403s all POST/DELETE behind ALB reverse-proxy subpath deployment

Linked tasks: independent of #1 and #3 (different subsystem, no shared files, no ordering dependency); shares the broader demo-v2ecoli e2e-walkthrough context with both.

### Status: ✅ ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED + FIX CODED/PUSHED (deploy pending in WS-D)

**2026-07-13 update:** Live probe CONFIRMED the ALB rewrites `Host` (403 even with a matching client `Host: localhost:8080`) and omits `X-Forwarded-Host`, so `--trust-proxy` is a dead end. Production-grade allowed-origins allowlist implemented + 33 tests pass, pushed as part of demo-v2ecoli `2c56cb8`; sms-api env pushed as `15c3391`. Folded into umbrella #4 (WS-B). See [[project_alb_rewrites_host_csrf]]. Prior status below (historical):

### (historical) ❌ DEPLOYED but STILL BROKEN — root cause of why the fix isn't taking effect NOT yet found

Fix landed in `481b3f2` (`demo-v2ecoli`, pushed; part of PR #465), deployed to sms-api-stanford-test with `--trust-proxy` in the pod args. Opt-in `trust_forwarded`/`forwarded_host` on `is_request_allowed()` + `--trust-proxy`/`VIVARIUM_WORKBENCH_TRUST_PROXY=1`; targeted suites pass. **But the 2026-07-13 browser walkthrough still hit the 403** (`POST /workbench/api/study-run-baseline → 403` reproduced server-side in pod logs). The fix is correct in isolation but isn't taking effect through the ALB→SSM-tunnel→k8s chain — likely `X-Forwarded-Host` never arrives, or the env check reads the wrong var, or uvicorn strips the header. Remaining: diagnose live headers (`curl -v` through tunnel or debug-log redeploy), then fix. See plan #2 "Post-deploy diagnosis" + `SAVE_SLOT.md`.

## 3. **(.todo/plans/3-fix-composite-resolve-unhandled-errors.md)**:

### Name

Fix: composite-resolve swallows real exceptions; colony (pymunk) composite 500s unobservably

Linked tasks: independent of #1 and #2 (different subsystem, no shared files, no ordering dependency); shares the broader demo-v2ecoli e2e-walkthrough context with both.

### Status: ❌ DEPLOYED, still 500s — but Tier 1 logging surfaced the real traceback; Tier 2a now unblocked

Tier 1 + Tier 2 landed in `481b3f2` (`demo-v2ecoli`, pushed; part of PR #465), deployed. Catch-all handler now `logger.exception(...)`s; both unguarded seams degrade via shared `_degraded_result()`. Targeted suites pass. **Tier 1 worked**: deployed logs captured `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bigraph_loom'` on the loom-asset route (not the guarded resolve seams) — the leading candidate for the real Bug 3, since the always-visible loom panel fires a loom-asset request for any composite. This IS the Tier 2a dependency fix that was gated on this evidence: the image builds from v2ecoli's lock (`Dockerfile:43-45`) which likely omits `bigraph-loom`, and the build sanity check (`Dockerfile:70`) doesn't import it. Remaining: confirm v2ecoli's lock omits it (local grep) + correlate a live colony click, then add a Dockerfile overlay install + sanity import. See plan #3 "Tier 2a — now unblocked". **Now absorbed into umbrella item #4** (v2ecoli lock confirmed to omit `bigraph-loom`).

## 4. **(.todo/plans/4-remote-govcloud-demo-e2e.md)**:

### Name

Close all gaps for a reproducible remote GovCloud dashboard demo (fix bugs #2 + #3; rewrite WALKTHROUGH remote-first; verify e2e; merge + release)

Linked tasks: **umbrella item that absorbs the remaining open work in #2 and #3** (the two blocking bugs) and depends on #1 (✅). Spans `demo-v2ecoli` (./) + `patch/db-filter` (`~/sms/sms-api`); `v2ecoli` main unchanged.

### Status: 🔄 EXECUTING — WS-A/B/C landed+pushed; build running; WS-D deploy + WS-E/F remaining

**2026-07-13 execution update:** WS-A/B/C/D all DONE + live-verified. Image `2c56cb8` built, deployed to `sms-api-stanford-test`, rolled out. Bug 2 (CSRF probe→405, was 403) + Bug 3 (`/workbench/bigraph-loom/`→200; `parca`+`colony` resolves→200) verified on the live pod. Pushed: dashboard `2c56cb8`, sms-api `15c3391`+`10159223`. Numbers reconciled to live (simulations 52→35; orphaned removed); all named elements present; Part B backbone confirmed (pod→sms-api /docs→200). REMAINING: WS-E full 8-segment browser drive (incl. live Run-remotely) + WS-F PRs. See `SAVE_SLOT.md` (ground truth).

### (historical) Status: PLANNED — approved plan, no code written yet

The demo is redefined to run against the REMOTE `/workbench` k8s deployment via `sms-proxy.sh -s smsvpctest` → `localhost:8080/workbench`. Bug 3 root cause CONFIRMED (v2ecoli `uv.lock` has zero `bigraph-loom`; combined image builds from that lock → `bigraph_loom` never installed → `ModuleNotFoundError` on the always-visible loom panel). Bug 2 NARROWED (AWS ALB omits `X-Forwarded-Host`, so `--trust-proxy` is a no-op; one live header capture pending) → production-grade allowed-origins allowlist chosen. Six workstreams: WS-A Bug 3 Dockerfile install + broadened sanity import; WS-B Bug 2 diagnose→allowlist (code on `demo-v2ecoli`, env on `patch/db-filter`); WS-C rewrite `WALKTHROUGH.md` remote-first (local flow → Appendix G); WS-D iterative build(gh-action)→deploy→verify on the two feature branches ONLY; WS-E full e2e walkthrough as the acceptance gate; WS-F merge + release, gated on WS-E reproducibility. Full plan: `.todo/plans/4-remote-govcloud-demo-e2e.md` (mirror at `~/.claude/plans/giggly-hatching-globe.md`).

## 5. **(.todo/plans/5-pinned-build-remote-runs.md)**:

### Name

Feat: pinned-build remote runs — submit sims against the latest **built** v2ecoli `main` simulator (no per-run push/build/login), unblocking the GovCloud demo's Segment 6 Part B.

Linked tasks: unblocks WS-E of #4 (Segment 6 Part B was the acceptance gate). Spans `vivarium-dashboard@demo-v2ecoli` (code) + `sms-api` overlay (env). No `v2ecoli` changes.

### Status: 🔄 EXECUTING — feature DEPLOYED + Part B PROVEN LIVE + P7 doc DONE; Segments 7–8 drive + WS-F PRs remain

**2026-07-13:** Part B was root-caused to 3 pod deployment gaps (A: no GH client_id → login disabled; B: `/workspace/.git` uid 17163 ≠ app uid 0 → dubious ownership; C: protected-main push). Fixed via the **pinned-build** model (Direction 1): resolve the latest built simulator for the configured repo@branch from in-cluster sms-api and skip Phase 1 (push/build/login) entirely; login gate relaxed only under declarative pinned config. Shipped dashboard `demo-v2ecoli 72e00b84` (img `72e00b8`, deployed) + sms-api `patch/db-filter 2ef52c0a`. **Proven live e2e**: sim 211 → ParCa → 3-node transient Ray MNP cluster → completed → landed (Simulations DB now 36). P7 WALKTHROUGH Segment 6 rewrite DONE. Segment 7 now coded/committed (see #6). Ground truth `SAVE_SLOT.md`.

---

## 6. **(.todo/plans/6-segment7-ptools-omics-deploy-verify.md)**:

### Name

Feat/verify: land Segment 7 (PTools Omics Viewer + interactive figures) across the coupled pair, live-verify Segments 7–8, record the demo, then open the post-completion release PRs.

Linked tasks: continues #5. The two coupled branches — dashboard `demo-v2ecoli` ↔ sms-api `patch/db-filter` — jointly deliver the whole demo (memory `[[project_demo_branch_coupling]]`); post-completion = PR merge + version-bump release into each `main`. No `v2ecoli` changes.

### Status: 🔄 EXECUTING — code committed on both branches; deploy + verify + record remain

**2026-07-13:** Segment 7 committed but not deployed: dashboard `demo-v2ecoli 7a9620c` (`/reports/` embed-URL base-path prefix so interactive figures resolve to the dashboard, not the co-tenant PTools at the ALB root) + sms-api `patch/db-filter c2a337cd` (seed `ui.dashboard_public_base_url` + clear `ui.ptools_data_dir` so the Omics Viewer overlay fetches study TSVs over HTTP). REMAINING: push → build image → repoint overlay `newTag` → roll out → live-verify Segment 7 (OPEN RISK: `sms-ptools:0.5.9` may ignore `celOv.shtml?…&url=`; 0.8.2 fallback = mount workspace at `/ptools-data`) + Segment 8 → stamp all 8 → record → WS-F release PRs. Ground truth `SAVE_SLOT.md`.
