"""FastAPI application — the typed seam for the dashboard's HTTP API.

This is the **seed of a strangler-fig migration**: the dashboard is served today
by a 16.9k-line stdlib ``http.server`` handler (``vivarium_dashboard/server.py``)
with hand-dispatched routes and untyped dict payloads. Rather than rewrite it in
one pass, we stand up a FastAPI app here that serves a small, growing set of
routes with **typed pydantic responses** (so they get automatic validation and
an OpenAPI schema). Routes move over a few at a time; both servers back onto the
same ``lib/`` functions, so there is one implementation, not two.

Run it standalone (does not yet replace the stdlib server):

    VIVARIUM_DASHBOARD_WORKSPACE=/path/to/workspace \\
        uvicorn vivarium_dashboard.api.app:app --reload

Today's routes are read-only and stateless (workspace-backed). Stateful routes
(e.g. remote-run status, which reads the in-memory RemoteRunManager owned by the
stdlib server) move over once the two servers share process state.
