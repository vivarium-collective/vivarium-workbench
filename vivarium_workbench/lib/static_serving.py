"""Static-asset + SPA-shell serving resolvers extracted from server.py.

These are the path-resolving helpers behind the Phase-C, Batch-16 **static /
SPA-shell** routes — the ``do_GET`` page/static branches (the bundled assets,
the workspace tree, the rendered ``reports/`` output, plus the standalone
``bigraph-loom`` and ``pbg_parsimony`` viewer bundles).  Unlike the JSON view
builders, the routes serve raw files (``FileResponse``), so these helpers return
a resolved :class:`~pathlib.Path` (or ``None`` / a traversal signal) plus the
mime guess — a single implementation driving both the legacy stdlib
``server.py`` handlers and the FastAPI seam.

Resolution contract (mirrors the legacy ``do_GET`` static branch EXACTLY):

* :func:`resolve_asset` — the generic 4-step priority: bundled ``STATIC_DIR`` →
  ``assets/`` prefix-strip retry against ``STATIC_DIR`` → the workspace tree →
  the rendered ``reports/`` dir (served unconditionally, so the caller 404s when
  the returned path is not a file).
* :func:`resolve_loom_asset` — ``vivarium_workbench.loom_assets.asset_dir()/rel``, raising
  :class:`AssetTraversal` on a ``..`` segment (the route maps it to 403).
* :func:`resolve_parsimony_asset` — the optional ``pbg_parsimony`` viewer dir
  (``None`` when the package is absent → the route 404s).
* :func:`index_html_path` — the SPA shell ``<ws>/reports/index.html`` (the route
  best-effort re-renders via ``lib.report.render_workspace_report`` first).

This module imports only ``lib`` (and the package itself for ``STATIC_DIR``),
never ``server``.
