"""Async materialization jobs (``docs/materialization-lifecycle.md`` §9c).

Runs the synchronous ``materialize`` primitive (§9b) **out-of-band** with progress
+ terminal state, so a ``bind``/``switch`` to a not-yet-materialized source can
return immediately (``MATERIALIZING``) instead of blocking the HTTP worker on a
minutes-scale ``uv sync`` — the worker never runs it inline (§3), and the query
path's 60 s socket timeout would kill it anyway (§1).

**This slice:** the in-process job registry — a background thread per environment
coordinate, **deduplicated** (§5: five sessions on one coordinate share one job,
not five ``uv sync``s), with coarse progress (``queued → syncing → ready | failed``)
and status polling. A cached venv is ``ready`` immediately (fast path). A failed
job is retried only on an explicit ``start`` (§4: FAILED is not retried in a loop).

**Deferred to §9d:** a detached *process* + durable record surviving restart (§7),
restart reconcile (in-flight → FAILED on a dead process), a ``uv sync`` concurrency
cap (§10), and GC. Progress here is in-memory — the same ephemeral tier as
``run_jobs.py``'s job manager (lost on restart); the durable artifact is the
coordinate-keyed venv on disk.
